        The add_action_entries() method is a convenience function for creating
                multiple Gio.SimpleAction instances and adding them to a Gio.ActionMap.
                Each action is constructed as per one entry.
        
                :param list entries:
                    List of entry tuples for add_action() method. The entry tuple can
                    vary in size with the following information:
        
                        * The name of the action. Must be specified.
                        * The callback to connect to the "activate" signal of the
                          action. Since GLib 2.40, this can be None for stateful
                          actions, in which case the default handler is used. For
                          boolean-stated actions with no parameter, this is a toggle.
                          For other state types (and parameter type equal to the state
                          type) this will be a function that just calls change_state
                          (which you should provide).
                        * The type of the parameter that must be passed to the activate
                          function for this action, given as a single GLib.Variant type
                          string (or None for no parameter)
                        * The initial state for this action, given in GLib.Variant text
                          format. The state is parsed with no extra type information, so
                          type tags must be added to the string if they are necessary.
                          Stateless actions should give None here.
                        * The callback to connect to the "change-state" signal of the
                          action. All stateful actions should provide a handler here;
                          stateless actions should not.
